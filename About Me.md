  I’m **passionate** about **data analytics** and am a seasoned high school math educator. With thirteen years of teaching experience and a **master’s degree** in **Applied Industrial Mathematics**, I have a unique skill set that combines teaching methods, instructional best practices, **analytical problem-solving**, and a deep understanding of data. Using these skills, I strive to bridge the gap between numbers and knowledge and **empower organizations** to make informed decisions. 

As a teacher, I use data to assess student mastery, identify misconceptions, and tailor instruction to meet individual needs. I have also mastered breaking down challenging mathematical concepts and **effectively presenting** them to learners of all ability levels. With these skills, I easily **communicate** and translate complex topics into clear, actionable recommendations for stakeholders and team members.

Outside the classroom, I can easily spend hours diving deep into data looking for trends and insights waiting to be uncovered. I am currently refining my skills in **Excel** and learning to apply my statistical knowledge to **Tableau** and **SQL**. I am excited to use my mathematical expertise and passion for **identifying patterns** to make **data-informed decisions** and optimize outcomes.
